Here are some of the projects I have worked on using C# in Microsoft Visual Studio with the Entity Framework.

## Projects

[Car Insurance](https://github.com/clcar23/T.A-basic-C-sharp-projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

[Student Database Creator](https://github.com/clcar23/T.A-basic-C-sharp-projects/tree/main/CodeFirstStudentDatabase)

### Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application showing a basic car insurance website. It takes user input for different
values and calculates a quote based on business logic. I've added in an Admin page that will display all the quotes
that have been issued.

### Student Database creator

This is a simple program utilizing the Entity Framework that follows the code-first model. Code in the main program
creates a database that students and their GPAs are recorded on.
